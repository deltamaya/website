## Why Use MPV?

MPV is not a player, it's video player's library, just like **VLC** and **VLC Player**.
But MPV is more light-weight and configurable, which could achieve a better watching experience.

## Download And Install

You could get the newest version of MPV player on Windows via this link: [mpv.net](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/releases)

Or you can use the cross-platform version: [mpv.io](https://mpv.io/installation/)

When your installation is done, you could play almost any kind of video, as libmpv is based on
FFmpeg, which provides a wide support for video codec and container format.

## Shortcuts

It's useful to remember a few shortcuts, which provides a faster access than GUI.

- `s` to save screenshot
- `t` or `i` to show stats
- `[`and`]` to adjust playback speed

Here is a quick reference to MPV shortcuts: [link](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#interactive-control)

## Configuration
Here is the most important part, you could fully control MPV player's behavior using a config file.
Go to the installation folder of MPV and create a folder called "portable_config", and then create a "mpv.conf" inside.
> [!TIP]
> If you didn't specify the installation path, it should locate at `C:/Users/{username}/AppData/Roaming/mpv/` or `C:/Program Files/mpv.net`.

Here is some basic configuration settings:
```ini
# use high quality render settings
profile=gpu-hq
cscale=catmull_rom
deband=yes
blend-subtitles=video
video-sync=display-resample

# reduce pull down judder
video-sync=display-resample
# interpolation=yes
tscale=oversample
icc-cache-dir="~~/icc_cache"
# enable hardware decoding
hwdec=d3d11va
# try all codecs with hwaccel
hwdec-codecs=all
gpu-shader-cache-dir="~~/shaders_cache"

keep-open=yes
save-position-on-quit=yes
screenshot-format=png
sub-auto=fuzzy
```
You could just copy-and-paste, or you could search the Internet and customize your own `mpv.conf` based your own computer setup.

Oh, by the way you could customize shortcuts using the `input.conf` in the same path.

## Shaders

MPV supports third party shaders, which your prettify your video experience.

In my circumstance, I'm going to use [Anime4K](https://github.com/bloc97/Anime4K), just download it the latest release
and move those `something.glsl` or `something.hook` into your config folder.

And if you are using Anime4K, add those into `input.conf` will enable the keyboard control of shaders:
```
# Optimized shaders for higher-end GPU
CTRL+1 no-osd change-list glsl-shaders set "~~/shaders/Anime4K_Clamp_Highlights.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Restore_CNN_VL.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_VL.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_AutoDownscalePre_x2.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_AutoDownscalePre_x4.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_M.glsl"; show-text "Anime4K: Mode A (HQ)"
CTRL+2 no-osd change-list glsl-shaders set "~~/shaders/Anime4K_Clamp_Highlights.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Restore_CNN_Soft_VL.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_VL.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_AutoDownscalePre_x2.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_AutoDownscalePre_x4.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_M.glsl"; show-text "Anime4K: Mode B (HQ)"
CTRL+3 no-osd change-list glsl-shaders set "~~/shaders/Anime4K_Deblur_DoG.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Restore_CNN_VL.glsl;~~/shaders/Anime4K_Upscale_CNN_x2_M.glsl.glsl;"; show-text "Anime4K: Mode C (HQ)"

CTRL+0 no-osd change-list glsl-shaders clr ""; show-text "GLSL shaders cleared"
```
If this doesn't fit for you, go check whether those filenames match your shader files in the config folder.

After that, you could toggle shader while playing video!
